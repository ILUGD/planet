# About

## Basic Guidlines for the Planet
This Planet is kind of an impression of the ILUGD volunteers hence you are required to follow some basic guidelines and the [COC](https://github.com/ILUGD/Code-of-Conduct).

### Do not inflame 
Profanities , Prejudice and offensive political comments are not welcome . Do not make personal attacks on other people or projects in your posts.

### Posts should be constructive
Blog feeds should not contain useless, destructive and negative material. Constructive criticism is welcome and the occasional rant is understandable , but a feed where every post is critical and negative is unsuitable. This helps keep the overall vibe of the planet positive. 

Please reach out to us on our chat channels such as on [telegram](https://t.me/joinchat/AmwdvEAc48xN_P0xRaR_7Q) or [matrix](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#ilugd:matrix.org) in case you are confused or doubtful about anything.
